# Coffee E-commerce Site Created With React and Redux

I wanted to build a mock e-commerce site that sold coffee beans, because a.) I love coffee, and b.) I wanted to put my JavaScript and React/Redux skills to the test. I also thought it would be really cool to see how one of these sites worked considering they make up a large portion of the web. I hope you enjoy looking at my web app.
