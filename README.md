# Coffee E-commerce Site Created With React and Redux

### How I Worked On This Project

My goal was to simulate a professional environment.

- I built this app with inspiration from basic e-commerce site styles
- I drew out file structure for React components
- I prototyped the app before building it with code
- I used Git to document the progress of my project

### Why I Built This Project

I wanted to build a mock e-commerce site that sold coffee beans, because a.) I love coffee, and b.) I wanted to put my JavaScript and React/Redux skills to the test. I also thought it would be really cool to see how one of these sites worked considering they make up a large portion of the web. Additionally, I wanted to practice data management using Redux, especially as more and more backend functionality moves to the browser.
