# Coffee E-commerce Site Created With React and Redux

I wanted to build a mock e-commerce site that sold coffee beans, because a.) I love coffee, and b.) I wanted to put my JavaScript and React/Redux skills to the test. I also thought it would be really cool to see how one of these sites worked considering they make up a large portion of the web. I hope you enjoy looking at my web app.

### How to View It Live

In the future I intend to host my app on the web, but in the meantime you can view it by making a copy of the repository. Make sure you have NPM and NPX installed , 'cd' into your local app and run 'npm start'. This should allow you to view my app via the web.
